# DataMining

This project is one of the creative exercises from Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne's Interdisciplinary Java programming book.
The program takes two URL's and a similarity value [0, 1) and recursively processes, and displays
websites that match the first URL, beginning at the second. It uses a vector sketch to compute similarity
between two bodies of text.

## Running the Program

You must use the stdlib.jar file, which can be found [here](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/).
